#+title: Emacs: The real GNU desktop environment?

* Emacs *is* a desktop environment

The case I'll try to make here is that Emacs is the ultimate desktop environment for hackers who prefer the GNU ecosystem of tools.

* What does a desktop environment usually provide?

- Window management
- Configuration and theming
- Basic productivity applications
- Device management
- System management

* Window management

- EXWM
- Workspaces with perspective.el

* Configuration and theming

- Emacs is fully themeable
- More configurable and hackable than any other DE
- Key bindings are very flexible

* Basic productivity applications

- Calendar
- Org Mode

* System management

- desktop-environment
- daemons
- pulseaudio-control.el
- emacs-guix (and GNU Guix itself)
