Hey Crafters!

I have created the [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/tree/craftedv2beta][Crafted Emacs v2 Beta branch]]!  There has been a lot of work to make it as stable as possible to get to this point, and while there is still work to be done, I feel the project has made it far enough along to get a new "release".  Please see the README on the site for information on the project, and my [[https://write.as/jeffbowman/crafted-emacs-v2-beta][blog post]] announcing this release!

Happy Crafting!
