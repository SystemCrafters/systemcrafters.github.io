* Updates

- Jeff Bowman wrote an article about the rename from Rational Emacs to Crafted Emacs: https://jeffbowman.writeas.com/from-rational-to-crafted-emacs

- A new way to support the channel: *Buy Mastering Emacs* with this link https://www.masteringemacs.org/r/systemcrafters

* Automating Tasks with Emacs Lisp

Today we're going to write a lot of Emacs Lisp code to automate a particular monotonous task: editing my YouTube video descriptions!

Why?  It's nice to be able to keep all of your video descriptions following a standard format so that they can be automatically updated using code for things like:

- Adding links to new playlists to every video
- Updating links to my websites
- Temporary links to occasional events I want to promote

Here's the flow I have in mind:

- Download the description of a particular video to a file on disk (in a temporary location)
- Open the buffer to make any desired edits
- Use a command to send the changes back to the original video
- Make it possible to download all video descriptions at once
- Create a bulk editing action to edit (and verify) changes to all description files
- Mass-upload all changed description files back to YouTube

We probably won't get through all of this today!  I do have a starting point, though.  My =live-crafter= package has some YouTube Data API code we can borrow to kick things off!
