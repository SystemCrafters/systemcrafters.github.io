* The Future of System Crafters

I love making content and engaging with this community.  I want to do even better!

Let's have a discussion about a few different areas where I might be able to improve.

For each area I'll suggest some ideas and I'd love to hear your thoughts on each one.  Suggest anything that you don't see there!

* What's the best way to present video content?

- Split up series into shorter videos (15 min) focusing on a more narrow aspect of the topic
- Shorter high-level videos with more detailed show notes?
- Don't change anything!
- Something else?  Any examples of other channels that do it well?

- Shorter getting started videos, longer advanced config video
- Setting the context better at the beginning of the video
- Check out egghead.io templates

* What's the best use of live streams?

- Community discussions around a topic
- Going more in-depth on the week's video topic
- Interviews with package authors and other interesting people (even multiple talking about the same topic, sharing workflows)
- Live coding

- Workflow demos
- More live streams?
- Community-suggested topics, what's cool this week
- Live coding with the purpose of showing workflow
- Pair programming and discussion
- Live preparation for videos
- Talking about Emacs News
- Live-coding Guix packages suggested by viewers

* What other forms of content would you be interested in?

- Books that go more in-depth
- Full video courses, possibly with exercises
- Podcast
- Newsletter

- Comparison videos like Ivy vs Vertico vs Selectrum, etc
- Short feature-focused videos to get people interested in Emacs

* What other topics would you be interested in?

- Learning programming languages
- More focus on using Emacs for personal productivity (Org Mode, Org Roam)
- Discussing other tools outside of Emacs / Lisp space
- Game streaming

- Shell programming, but maybe with things like Babashka, Guile, Elisp, etc
- Window managers - StumpWM
- Getting better at scripting/automating your system
- Talking about my streaming/recording setup
- Learning how to read Emacs package code
- Keyboard-specific material like QMK, kmonad
- Prog langs like Nim, Crystal, Zig, Scheme, things that are more obscure
- Antipatterns in Emacs config
- Explaining the "emacs model"
- Book reviews and discussions
- Contributing to Emacs or Guix

* What do you think would make it worthwhile to become a sponsor?

- Sponsor-only content like behind the scenes, prep streams
- Special member activities (book club, weekly discussions, learning projects)
- Being more of a community-within-the-community
- "Free" merch (stickers, etc)
- Different sponsorship platform?  Liberapay, subscribestar

- Better pubnix
- Code review

* What are some good ways to fund the channel long term?

- Sponsorship / membership
- Paid content like books or courses
- Merchandise (t-shirts, stickers, mugs, etc)
- Hands-on learning events
- Something else you're not getting that would be valuable?
