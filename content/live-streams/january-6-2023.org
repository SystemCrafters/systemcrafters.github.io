* Hacking Guix Home Services in the REPL

Today I want to spend some time learning how to hack on Guix Home services in the Guile REPL so that I can build up a service without running =guix home container= a bunch of times!

#+begin_src scheme

  (use-modules (guix store))

  (let* ((server (open-connection))
         (path (add-text-to-store server "hello.txt" "Hello Guix!")))
    (display "The store path is: ")
    (display path)
    (newline)
    (close-connection server))

#+end_src

- =(build-derivations store derivations [mode])=: Builds a list of derivations against the given store

  #+begin_src scheme

    (define (sh-symlink)
      (gexp->derivation "sh"
                        #~(symlink (string-append #$bash "/bin/bash")
                                   #$output)))

    (run-with-store (open-connection) (sh-symlink))

  #+end_src
