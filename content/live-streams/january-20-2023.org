* Configuring Sway with Scheme

Today we're going to take a look at the Sway compositor for Wayland.  I've been playing with it for the last day and I like it so far!

I'd like to try creating a Guile Scheme library that will make it possible to configure Sway using Scheme code, either as a =.scm= file or at the REPL.

** What is Sway?

** Benefits

- No =xrandr= or =arandr=, configure displays
- No =.desktop= or =.xsession= needed, just run =sway=
- You can pin specific workspaces to displays!

** Drawbacks

- Sometimes hard to make applications play nice with Wayland

** The final code
