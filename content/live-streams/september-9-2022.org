* Generating a Blog Site from Denote Entries

I've really been enjoying Prot's package Denote recently:

https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote

It works well with how I like to write notes, basically as a linear series of entries to capture my thoughts over time.

Now that I've been using it for a couple of months, I'd like to start generating my personal website from a tagged subset of my Denote files so that I can share some of my personal writings with the public.

Today we'll hack some Emacs Lisp to figure out a simple way to generate such a website!
