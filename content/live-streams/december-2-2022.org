* Taking a Look at Emacs 29

This week, Eli Zaretskii created the release branch for Emacs 29!

There are some huge new features in this release!  Today I'd like to try out a recent build of Emacs 29 and follow along with this really excellent post by Lucien Cartier-Tilet aka Phundrak (https://fosstodon.org/@phundrak):
