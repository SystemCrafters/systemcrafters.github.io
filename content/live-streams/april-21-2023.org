* Updates

- Updated my Emacs configuration to remove Straight.el and setup.el, now back to =use-package= and =package.el= in Emacs 29!

- Jeff Bowman has been working hard on Crafted Emacs v2!  We'll discuss it next Friday, but until then, check it out here:

* Moving to Matrix, Feedback Wanted!

I've been mulling over this for a while and I think I'm finally ready to proceed: the System Crafters community chat will be moving from Discord to Matrix and IRC!

Here are some things I'd like to know:
