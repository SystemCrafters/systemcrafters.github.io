* Let's try =dwl-guile=!

I've mentioned a few times recently that I've really enjoyed using Wayland via Sway recently.  It's the future!  However, we haven't really seen many Lisp or Scheme-based compositors yet.

[[https://github.com/engstrand-config/dwl-guile][dwl-guile]] is a fork of the [[https://github.com/djpohly/dwl][dwl]] Wayland Compositor (which is a port of [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]]).

=dwl-guile= was developed to be used with GNU Guix!  There is a custom Guix channel which also provides a Guix Home service for configuring the window manager:

Today we'll see if we can get =dwl-guile= up and running and see if it can be a solid addition to our modern, Lisp-based system crafting toolset!
