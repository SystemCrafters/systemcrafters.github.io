* I'm Rewriting My Configuration Again

Next year will be interesting!  I've got some ambitious plans for my personal projects and I've been thinking a lot about what changes I need to make to my personal configuration and my streaming setup.

** What are my plans and how do they affect how I use my computer(s)?

Starting a new channel to focus on building audio/visual tools from scratch and making things with them!

Need to have multiple desktop environment configurations for different use cases:

- EXWM from System Crafters videos/streams
- Another window manager for A/V tool hacking streams (dwm, i3, StumpWM, Guile-WM, bspwm/herbsluftwm)
- Multi-PC streaming setup to ensure that nothing I do kills the stream
- Maybe use a different Linux distribution for the media machine

** Cleaning up and presenting my configuration more effectively

- Maybe setting up a shared base configuration (bare-emacs, needs a better name) and build on that
- Invest more in converting to Guix Home
- However, try to find the balance between Guix Home and normal config files
- Creating a better configuration website and presentation

** Improving the quality of streams and videos

- Visual demonstrations with graphics
- Having a more interesting screen layout (experiment with OBS)
- More/better music for System Crafters videos and streams
- Multiple cameras
- Synchronizing activity between machines for streaming and recording
