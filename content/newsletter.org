#+title: System Crafters Newsletter

Receive the latest insights, tips, and content from System Crafters by signing up for my weekly newsletter!

*Every Thursday*, I will send out an e-mail giving you the latest updates for the System Crafters website, YouTube channel, and community.  I'll also include a few quick tips and information about what I've learned in the wider Emacs, Guix, and Linux communities!

For those who are concerned about privacy and spam, I promise that all e-mails will be sent in plain-text format with no trackers included.  I will also only send a maximum of 2 e-mails a week in the /rare/ case.  I want this mailing list to be high value and low noise for everyone!
